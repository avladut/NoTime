NoTime
======

My task management application for Android
This application is ment to help me understand the basics of Android programming. 
Description:
-NoTime should display a list of tasks for the current user, as well as the deadline, in order of their priority.
-Priority is set by user and will be used to determine a task's order in the display list
-The application should display the statistics of the current, completed and failed tasks
-The user can add a link to a folder with relevant files for every task
-The tasks are stored in a SQLite database, accesible by a Content Provider
-The list is loaded asynchrounously to prevent the blocking of the UI
